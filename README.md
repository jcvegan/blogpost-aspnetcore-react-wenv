# How to work with .env file with multiple environment using React and ASP .net core?
Sample project for handling environmental variables using asp .net core and react.

# The problem:
ASP .net core have 3 default environments:
 - Development
 - Staging
 - Production
 
The same happens to Node.js
 - Development
 - Staging
 - Production
 
 But what happens when we develop a solution using both (ASP .Net core and React).
 Is it possible to tight each environment from .net with its corresponding node environment?
